  text("Frances E. Allen was a computer scientist that began working for IBM in the late 1950’s. Over her 45 year career,\n" +

  "translates high-level programming languages (what most programmers use today) into lower-level instructions that a machine can read.\n" +
  "Parallelism is the state in which more than one instruction is being operated on at once. This increases the speed at which machines work.\n\n" +
  
  "Speed and efficiency were Dr. Allen’s main concerns while working for IBM and this came of great use.\n" +
  "When she and her team modified and installed a version of Stretch (a supercomputer system at the time) for the NSA, this helped collect and analyze\n" +
  "huge amounts of data during the Cold War. Her work hasn’t just benefited IBM or the NSA, as most computers in use today make heavy use of parallelism in order to run faster.", 50, 400);
